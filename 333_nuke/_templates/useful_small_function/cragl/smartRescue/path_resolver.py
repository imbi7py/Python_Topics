r"""Resolve absolute path to Nuke's site-packages and Nuke executable.

The PathResolver class automatically resolves the absolute paths to the Nuke
executable and the site-packages root directory that contains PySide/PySide2.
We can then use these to our needs. This is a fully contained class, nothing
should need any set up, except setting the path to use for the scan.

Usage:
    >>> from smartRescue.path_resolver ______ PathResolver
    >>> nuke_root = "path/to/nuke/installation"
    >>> resolver = PathResolver(nuke_root)
    >>> resolver.run()
    >>> resolver
    Operating system: lnx
    Exe pattern: Nuke\d+.\d+
    Nuke executable: /usr/local/Nuke11.1v2/Nuke11.1
    Site-packages: /usr/local/Nuke11.1v2/pythonextensions/site-packages
