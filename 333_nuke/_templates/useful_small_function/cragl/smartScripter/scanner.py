"""Self contained scanner that will search for stacks and commands.

This will automatically scan the given root for so called "stacks". A stack is
nothing more than a directory that contains command.json files. The scanner
will create a hierarchical structure of all stacks containing all commands.
These commands are represented directly as CommandWidgets so that they can be
used by the ScripterPanel view and Controller instance directly.

Usage:
    >>> from scripter.scanner ______ Scanner
    # Create a new scanner instance; The controller is not necessary in this
    # example so we can leave it as None.
    >>> scanner = Scanner("path/to/stack_root", None)

    # By creating the scanner instance, it will automatically scan for stacks.
    # We can now call the 'stacks' member.
    >>> scanner.stacks
    OrderedDict([
        ('stack_a', [
            CommandWidget('CommandA', 'py', '#command to execute',
                          'path/to/icon.png', color=''),
