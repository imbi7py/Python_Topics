# An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.
#
# Your goal is to find that missing element.
#
# Write a function:
#
#     def solution(A)
#
# that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.
#
# For example, given array A such that:
#   A[0] = 2
#   A[1] = 3
#   A[2] = 1
#   A[3] = 5
#
# the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
#         N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
#         the elements of A are all distinct;
#         each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
