# Note: The numbers can be arbitrarily large and are non-negative
# Solutions:

c_ Solution:
    # @param num1, a string
    # @param num2, a string
    # @return a string
    ___ multiply(self, num1, num2):
        r_ st.(in.(num1)*in.(num2))


Solution().multiply("122326161616161616","-161651616161616")
