# Python - Logging Example

## Author
Brandon Rodriguez

## Description
An example of using Python's built in logging functionality.

### Logging.py
The standard "logging.py" file should be fine to use in most instances. For some applications, such as Django projects,
logging settings dict may need to be extended or further customized.

### Extended_logging.py
The "extended_logging.py" has an example of creating custom log levels. However, this is usually uneccesary, and should
generally be avoided unless Python's default logging levels are insufficient. Otherwise, this file is identical to
"logging.py".
