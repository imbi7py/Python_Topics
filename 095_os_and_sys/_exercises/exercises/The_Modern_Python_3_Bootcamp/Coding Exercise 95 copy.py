# # Copy Solution
# #
# # Copy should copy contents from one file to another.  For example, after running:
#
# """
# copy('story.txt', 'story_copy.txt') # None
# """
#
# # We would expect the contents of story.txt and story_copy.txt to now be the same.
# #
# # Here's my solution:
#
#
# ___ co.. file_name new_file_name
#     w__ o.. ? __ file
#         text _ ?.r..
#
#     w__ o.. ? _ __ new_file
#         ?.w.. ?
