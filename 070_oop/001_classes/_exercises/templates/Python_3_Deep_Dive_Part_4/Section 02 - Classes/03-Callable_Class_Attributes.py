# ### Callable Class Attributes
# '''
#
# # %%
# '''
# Class attributes can be any object type, including callables such as functions:
# '''
#
# # %%
# c_ Program
#     language _ 'Python'
#
#     ___ say_hello
#         print(_*Hello f___  ?.l.. !*
#
# # %%
# print ?.-d
# #
# # # %%
# # '''
# # As we can see, the `say_hello` symbol is in the class dictionary.
# # We can also retrieve it using either `getattr` or dotted notation:
# # '''
# #
# # # %%
# print ?.s._h. g.. ? 'say_hello'
# #
# # # %%
# # '''
# # And of course we can call it, since it is a callable:
# # '''
# #
# # # %%
# ?.s._h.
# #
# # # %%
# # getattr(Program, 'say_hello')()
# #
# # # %%
# # '''
# # We can even access it via the namespace dictionary as well:
# # '''
# #
# # # %%
# print ?.-d 'say_hello'
# #
# # # %%
